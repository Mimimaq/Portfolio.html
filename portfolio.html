        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I currently don't have any projects since I'm a novice in IT and still learning.</p>
        <p1> Am finding the commands a bit confusing since am leaning for the different IDE's that we're using like VS Code, Gitbash and Python.
        <p> But am getting to understand them slowly as I shoot in the dark</p2>
